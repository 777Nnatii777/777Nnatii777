- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @777Nnatii777 ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±
Hello, my name is Natan MÅ‚ynarczyk, I am a young, ambitious IT technician/programmer. I am studying Computer Science at the University of Bieslko-BiaÅ‚a. I have always been interested in computers, physics and the development of new technologies. That's why now, while developing my IT career, I'm eager to learn new things and get to know new technologies.

I have strong logical thinking, analysis and problem-solving skills. A creative approach to the challenges presented to me. I have a positive attitude towards working in a team and working on new technologies, always willing to learn from others and from work.
